## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a robotics student actively exploring robot navigation using the Robot Operating System (ROS). This repository documents my learning journey and hands-on projects focused on building, simulating, and testing autonomous navigation systems.

My work revolves around solving core robotics challenges like localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. Using ROS as the foundation, Iâ€™m developing packages that bring together sensor data, mapping algorithms, and motion control to enable robots to navigate complex environments safely and efficiently.

Iâ€™m gaining experience with tools like RViz, Gazebo, and rosbag, as well as key ROS packages such as move_base, AMCL, and Nav2 (for ROS 2). These tools help me visualize sensor input, simulate robots in dynamic worlds, and fine-tune navigation stacks for better performance.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a mix of real-world and simulation-based projects, including SLAM setups, costmap tuning, robot localization with LiDAR and odometry, and integration with custom robot models. I aim to build solutions that are modular, well-documented, and reusable for future robotics applications.

Beyond the technical side, Iâ€™m also learning how to design systems that are robust in noisy, unpredictable environmentsâ€”an essential skill in real-world robotics. I focus on debugging techniques, launch file organization, and keeping code maintainable across different robot platforms.

If you're working with ROS or interested in robotics navigation, feel free to explore the code, clone the projects, or collaborate. Iâ€™m always excited to learn from others in the robotics community and share what Iâ€™ve learned through open-source work.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building smarter, more autonomous robots, one waypoint at a time.
